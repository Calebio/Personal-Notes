# SC-500 Study Plan: Course SC-500T00 Mapped to Weekly Plan

Exam date: **24 Oct 2026**. SC-100 follows on 29 Nov 2026.

## Week 1 (30 Sep – 4 Oct): AI security, the biggest gap
**Learning path: Implement Security for AI** (all 9 modules are new)
1. Secure access for Microsoft Entra Agent Identity
2. Analyze AI identity risks using Microsoft Defender XDR
3. Enable real-time protection for Copilot Studio agents
4. Configure AI Gateway security in Microsoft Foundry
5. Configure and manage guardrails in Microsoft Foundry
6. Protect AI workloads with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
7. Enable Defender for AI Services workload protection
8. Manage agents using Microsoft Agent 365
9. Identify AI data risks using Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)

## Week 2 (5–11 Oct): Microsoft Sentinel, hands-on in the lab
**Learning path: Implement Activity and Event Collection in Microsoft Sentinel** (all 8 modules)
1. Create and manage Sentinel workspaces
2. Manage content in Sentinel
3. Connect Microsoft services to Sentinel
4. Connect Syslog data sources
5. Connect Common Event Format (CEF) logs
6. Connect Windows hosts
7. Implement automation rules and playbooks (quick, since you already build Logic Apps)
8. Manage data storage and query audit logs

## Week 3 (12–18 Oct): networking, Security Copilot and posture management
**Learning path: Implement Network Security Controls in Azure**
- **Focus:** Azure Firewall for central traffic inspection; VPN gateways and **Entra Private Access**; removing public network exposure of PaaS services with Private Link.
- **Skim:** segmenting and isolating workloads with network security controls (you already work with NSGs).
- **From the documentation only (no course module):** Virtual Network Manager, Virtual WAN, Network Watcher. Allow about an hour.

**Learning path: Deploy and Operate Microsoft Security Copilot** (all 3 modules)
- Describe Security Copilot · configure workspaces · manage plugins and agents

**Learning path: Manage Security Posture with Defender for Cloud**
- **Focus:** connecting hybrid and multicloud environments (your AWS experience helps) · **Defender External Attack Surface Management (EASM)** · Defender Vulnerability Management settings for Azure VMs
- **Skim:** Cloud Security Posture Management risks · regulatory compliance · workload protection plans

## Week 4 (19–23 Oct): review what you already know, then the practice assessment

| Learning path | Notes |
|---|---|
| Secure access to resources with Entra | Authentication methods and PIM are familiar. **Read properly:** "Authenticate your API plugin for declarative agents with secured APIs". |
| Configure Key Vault security | Daily work |
| Security governance and compliance | Azure Policy, RBAC, custom roles, IaC security controls |
| Implement Azure Storage security | Mostly AZ-500 material |
| Implement Azure SQL Database security | You run SQL Managed Instance |
| Server and VM security | Bastion, just-in-time access, disk encryption, Defender for Servers, Azure Arc |
| Secure application platform services | AKS, ACR, Functions and Logic Apps, App Service and WAF are familiar. **Read properly:** API Management backend security (links to the week 1 AI Gateway work). |

Take the **Microsoft Learn practice assessment** around 20 Oct, then spend the last few days on whatever it shows you're weak on. Keep the day before the exam light.

## Notes
- SC-500 is new, so third-party material is thin. Rely on the official study guide, the Microsoft Learn paths and the free practice assessment.
- Security Copilot and some AI features need licences you likely won't have. Learn those from the documentation and Microsoft's interactive demos rather than setting them up.
- Passing SC-500 is what unlocks the Cybersecurity Architect Expert title from SC-100 (29 Nov).
